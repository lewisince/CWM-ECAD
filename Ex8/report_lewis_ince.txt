Understanding the results: 


1) There were no critical errors in the final run of the synthesis. 

2) Worst case of hold time in the design was 0.048ns.

3) Worst case of setup time was 9.29ns.

4) There were 4 LUT used by the design.

5) There were 2 FF used by the design.

6) There was no block RAM used by the design, as there was no requirement for memory (e.g. initialisation vector) in this design for the temperature implementation.

7) The expected total power consumption was 2.474W, but less than 1% of this power was Dynamic (from Clocks, Signals, Logic or I/O implementation).

8) To synthesise the system, it took 3m47s, but to explore all fully routed nets, implementing for optimization, it took 13m58s.
